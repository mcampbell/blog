# Programming Languages

As I've come through many different development cycles, fads, processes, and languages in
my career, I've come to a point where I'm getting less interested in languages because
they're all just kind of a way to one goal:  Mapping an idea in my mind to something the
computer understands.  A way to tell the computer what to do.  And since they're so
stupid, you gotta be _explicit_ in one very real sense, but abstracted in another because
we don't communicate in 0/1.

This has a lot of implications and related topics I might touch on in the future.
