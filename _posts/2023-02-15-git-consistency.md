I know that `git` isn't mean to be any sort of UX poster child, but this is something that
has gnawed at me a bit, and that's the "how do you show all the things" commands/flags.

These are in order of the rough frequency that I use them.

## Show All The What's?

(The `...` are meant to be a dramatic pause, not part of the command.)

branches => `git branch`, or `git branch ... -a`, or `git branch ... -r`

stashes => `git stash ... list`

remotes => `git remote ... -v`

tags => `git tag #... nothing!`

reflogs => `git reflog ... --all`

I'm sure there are good reasons for each one, but it does feel like each command was
designed or written by a different person at different times.
